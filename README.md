# A little ecosystem simulation

So you read random readme of random projects?

It's a toy simulation.

I have "student" verison in `c_student_version` done while I was student.
I am rewriting in rust for fun, may add lot of stupid feature and overengineer
it with an ECS just for fun.

I may add a comparaison of Rust and C version and why the C version
is flawed. Or a blog-post.

May also update the C version and do benchmarks just for fun.
May add heap-allocation/perf analysis and post a blog post.

Don't know it's mostly archeology in my student years projects for fun and
nostlagia. ;P

## Licence?

I suppose I must choose one for the Rust version, I am free to choose.

The C version could'nt have an open one since it's a shared work with a university
fellow student and I lost contact.
